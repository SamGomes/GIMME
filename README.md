GIMME (Group Interactions Management for Multiplayer sErious games) is a research tool which focuses on the management of 
interactions in groups so that the collective ability improves. 
More specifically, 
What sets the method appart is that the interactions between players are explicity considered when forming group configurations (also called coalition structures in some problems).
This repository contains the core of the application (written in Python), as well as some examples. 
Over time, we aim to improve the core functionalities as well as provide more examples for GIMME.


## Requirements

GIMME only requires Python 3 in order to be executed (Tested in Python 3.7.4). No additional tools are required.
Tested on Windows and Linux. May also work in MacOS.


## Setup

GIMME setup is straightforward. You just got to install the python package:

python setup.py install

And then execute your program. For example, to execute the provided simulations, you just have to enter the folder and call python:

cd examples
python simulations.py
