# GIMME

![logo](Images/GIMMELogo.png)

GIMME (Group Interactions Management for Multiplayer sErious games) is a research tool which focuses on the management of 
interactions in groups so that the collective ability improves. In other words, states are collected from each user in a multi-user environment, and then groups are formed and interaction profiles are generated taking in account those states.
This repository contains the core of the application (written in C++), as well as some exporting utilities. One of such utilities is a C# bridge which can be use in tools such as Unity 3D.
Over time, we aim to improve the core functioning as well as provide a library of demos for GIMME. Currently, we are working on a UI developed in Unity3D.
GIMME's website can be visited in the link associated to the deployment of this repository (![logo](Images/logo.png)).
